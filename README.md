# Description
This app draws upon three APIs to show users a variety of information related to their birthday. Upon arriving to the page, the user enters their birth month and day using a dropdown menu. From this information, the user is shown their zodiac sign horoscope (pulled from the Aztro API), the NASA Image of the Day from their birthday in 2018 (pulled from the NASA Astronomy of the Day API), and another famous person born on the same day (pulled from the Wikipedia Born On This Day API). 

# Installation
Our app was built on the Bulma CSS framework (https://bulma.io/) using three third-party APIs: Aztro (https://aztro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#), NASA Astrology of the Day (https://api.nasa.gov/), and Wikipedia Born on this Day (https://en.wikipedia.org/api/rest_v1/#/Feed/onThisDay). 

# User Story
There are few things that every single person has in common, but we are united in the fact that we all have a birthday; we built this app to give new perspective to that special occasion. Users--anyone with a birthday--will be granted multiple different perspectives on their birthday. The NASA Astronomy of the Day shows the image of the day posted by NASA on the user's birthday, a gorgeous reminder of the magnitude and beauty of the universe as we celebrate our place within it. Wikipedia's Born On This Day feed lets the user know of another person profiled on Wikipedia born on the same day, an interesting fun fact and avenue for learning based on a little shared kinship. Finally, horoscopes (powered by Aztro API) provide the user a bit of star-powered guidance to help them move through the day. Our app was designed with mobile users in mind, using the Bulma CSS framework for its mobile-first responsive features.
